Description: The standard use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
    in controlling the long run quality of an experimental system works poorly in
    the confines of a single experiment. However, in the special case of massively
    parallel hypothesis testing, it is possible to convert it into an effective
    tool for describing the quality of a single experiment. To his end we introduce
    the concept of stable retrospective power (SRP), which complements the false
    discovery rate (FDR) and allows to reach meaningful conclusions about the
    quality of a single study. This enables to objectively plan for replication
    studies, and to estimate the quality of important parts of scientific literature
    without having to replicate them.
